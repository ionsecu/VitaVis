VitaVis 0.9
-----------

by [Roman Lehnhof] (http://www.lehnhof.net)

VitaVis is an open HTML/CSS framework for standardised, non-linear CVs (see [example](http://lehnhof.net/vitavis/picard/cv.html)). To create your own theme, override the stylesheet. Leave class and ID selectors untouched to retain data comparability (see "future plans" below).

You can run multiple vitas in one folder.

This is a prototype, please make suggestions.

##Files
    assets               - Folder containing CSS files and images
	assets\font-awesome  - Folder containing icon set
	assets\normalize.css - Anti-CSS
	assets\style.css     - Stylesheet
    demo.html            - Demo vita

###Future plans

* Print stylesheet
* Pre-processor with UI for applicants
* Post-processor with UI for employers

###Basic use case

1. Download
2. Modify content of demo vita
3. Write your own stylesheet, if needed
4. Name folder and file as you see fit
5. Upload to own web space
